Progress throughout this branch consisted of giving more of an Ultramine look and feel from one of Warhammer's Space Marine chapters as the standard coffee theme sadly does not pertain to the topic.

#### Steps covered so far
- Navigate to ```public > css > styles.css```.
- Search for ```body``` CSS selector.
- Applied a diagonal gradient that transitions smoothly through a range of shades of Macragge Blue (```#0a2531, #1f4f72, #2b6f8f, #0a2531```) at angle of 135&deg;.
