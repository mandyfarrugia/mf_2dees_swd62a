# 2Dees
This branch encompasses a migration related to a table representing a list of items, as well as assigning constraints, namely a foreign key to related an item to a category. One category can hold many items, but items can only be associated with one category, hence a one-to-many relationship will be established. The use of ```->onDelete('cascade')``` denotes that if a category is deleted, then so will its associated items as well. In Laravel, with respect to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) software design architecture, the developer will not interact directly with the tables, but instead through model classes representing the tables. To begin populating items and categories with initial data, Tinker will be used.
